\title{Fit a model with INLA}
\usage{
FitModel(..., formula = NULL, CovNames = NULL, mesh, spat.ind = "i",
  predictions = FALSE, tag.pred = "pred")
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Data stacks.}

\item{formula}{If not NULL (the default), the formula to be used in the model fitting.
Does not have to contain the spatial term if spat.ind is specified.}

\item{CovNames}{Names of covariates to use. If NULL will use all in stack effects.}

\item{mesh}{INLA mesh.}

\item{spat.ind}{Index for spatial mesh. Defaults to i (which is used elsewhere n this package).
Set to NULL if no spatial term is wanted.}

\item{predictions}{Boolean: should predictions be made? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{tag.pred}{Name of tag for predictions. Defaults to "pred".}
}
\value{
If predictions is TRUE, a list with
    - model: an object of class INLA, with the results of the analysis in them.
    . predictions: Posterior means and standard deviationsfor linear predictor for predictions. Note that
    If predictions is FALSE, just the model.
