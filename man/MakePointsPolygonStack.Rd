\title{Function to create stack for small presence/absence polygons}
\usage{
MakePointsPolygonStack(polys, data, coords = c("X", "Y"), mesh,
  polydatanames = NULL, respName = "Present", tol = 0.1,
  tag = "polygon", InclCoords = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{polys}{Spatial polygon data frame.}

\item{data}{Data frame with columns for coordinates, and others are covariates.}

\item{coords}{Names for columns with coordinates in data.}

\item{mesh}{INLA mesh.}

\item{polydatanames}{Names of covariate data in polygon object. Defaults to NULL, which means no covariate data at polygon level.}

\item{respName}{Name for response (e.g. presence/absence). Might be possible to use >1, but haven't tried.}

\item{tol}{Tolerance for converting points to spatial pixels.}

\item{tag}{Name for tag for the stack (defaults to "points").}

\item{InclCoords}{Boolean, should coordinates be included in data (defaults to FALSE).}
}
\value{
An INLA stack, which will be treated as points in the analysis.
